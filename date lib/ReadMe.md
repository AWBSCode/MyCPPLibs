# clsDate Class

## Introduction

The `clsDate` class is a C++ implementation for handling date-related operations. It provides functionalities to work with dates, including parsing date strings, performing date arithmetic, checking validity, and formatting dates.

## Features

- Parsing date strings in the format "DD/MM/YYYY" and creating date objects.
- Getting system date.
- Checking the validity of a date.
- Converting dates to strings.
- Performing date arithmetic such as adding or subtracting days, months, years, and more.
- Calculating the difference in days between two dates.
- Determining whether a date falls on a weekend or a business day.
- Comparing dates.

## Usage

### Installation

To use the `clsDate` class, include the `clsDate.h` header file in your C++ project.

### Creating Date Objects

You can create `clsDate` objects using various constructors:

```cpp
clsDate date1; // Current system date
clsDate date2("20/02/2024"); // Date from string
clsDate date3(20, 2, 2024); // Date with day, month, year
```

### Accessing Date Components

You can access the day, month, and year components of a date object using getter methods:

```cpp
short day = date1.Day();
short month = date1.Month();
short year = date1.Year();
```

### Date Arithmetic

You can perform arithmetic operations on date objects, such as adding or subtracting days, months, or years:

```cpp
date1.AddDays(7); // Add 7 days to date1
date2.SubtractMonths(1); // Subtract 1 month from date2
```

### Date Comparison

You can compare date objects using comparison methods:

```cpp
if (date1.IsAfter(date2)) {
    // date1 is after date2
} else if (date1.IsBefore(date2)) {
    // date1 is before date2
} else {
    // date1 is equal to date2
}
```

### Other Operations

- Validating a date: `date1.IsValid()`
- Converting a date to string: `string dateString = date1.ToString()`

For more details on available methods and their usage, refer to the source code documentation.
